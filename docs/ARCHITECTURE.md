Kryton is deliberately split at the **provider boundary**. Callers see one stable machine API; providers translate it into demo state, dockur compose stacks, libvirt domains, or KubeVirt VirtualMachines. Windows and Linux guests share the same contract; Linux guests are configured through `initialization` (cloud-init user and SSH keys).

## Take a closer look

=== "Demo"

    | | |
    |---|---|
    | Use case | Local eval, CI smoke tests |
    | Source of truth | In-memory map |
    | Guests | None — instant fake machines for eval |

    Intentionally in-memory; data is lost on restart.

=== "Dockur"

    | | |
    |---|---|
    | Use case | Lab hosts with Docker/Podman + KVM |
    | Source of truth | Compose state under `KRYTON_DOCKUR_DATA_DIR` |
    | Guests | Windows via [dockur/windows](https://github.com/dockur/windows) |

    Compose projects and disk images persist under `KRYTON_DOCKUR_DATA_DIR`. See [DOCKUR.md](DOCKUR.md) for the lab provider.

=== "Libvirt"

    | | |
    |---|---|
    | Use case | A single KVM host without Docker or Kubernetes |
    | Source of truth | libvirt domains plus metadata under `KRYTON_LIBVIRT_DATA_DIR` |
    | Guests | Linux cloud images (Ubuntu, Debian, Rocky, AlmaLinux) with cloud-init |

    Images come from `kryton-image fetch` against an approved SHA-256; each machine gets a QCOW2 overlay and a cloud-init seed. Initial host backend, not GA. See [LINUX-TEMPLATES.md](LINUX-TEMPLATES.md).

=== "KubeVirt"

    | | |
    |---|---|
    | Use case | Production Kubernetes estates |
    | Source of truth | Kubernetes API |
    | Guests | Windows golden images and Linux cloud images via CDI `DataSource` objects |

    Kubernetes is authoritative. Kryton is stateless with respect to machine inventory and can be restarted without losing machine identity. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for production.

## Stable identity

A Kryton machine receives a **UUID** independent from its provider name. The KubeVirt provider records the UUID and project in labels and preserves the original Kryton specification in a managed annotation. External clients therefore never need to address `namespace/name` directly.

The dockur provider maps UUIDs to compose project directories. The demo provider holds machines in a process-local map.

---

## Single-replica today

Run exactly one `krytond` replica. Two in-process pieces of state make more than one unsafe right now:

- **`internal/reconciler/ttl.go`** has no leader election — every replica independently lists and expires the same machines on its own timer, which is at best redundant work and at worst a race between replicas' `Delete` calls.
- **`internal/events/events.go`**'s `Bus` holds its event history and SSE subscriber set purely in-process (an in-memory ring buffer, optionally mirrored to a local JSONL file) — with multiple replicas, `GET /api/v1/events` and `GET /api/v1/events/stream` return different results depending on which pod a client's connection or load-balanced request lands on.

The Helm chart's `deploy/helm/kryton/values.yaml` pins `replicaCount: 1` and ships a `podDisruptionBudget` template disabled by default for the same reason. Scaling `krytond` out requires either a leader-elected TTL loop (e.g. a Kubernetes Lease) or moving it to a single CronJob, plus a shared events backend (e.g. Redis/DB-backed, or a single-writer SSE fan-out) — neither exists today. This is distinct from [GA.md](GA.md)'s "Live migration / HA replicas" note, which is about the KubeVirt **guest VM**, not krytond itself.

---

## Projects

Kryton projects map to provider isolation domains:

- **KubeVirt** — one Kubernetes namespace per project (optionally prefixed by `KRYTON_NAMESPACE_PREFIX`).
- **dockur** — project is recorded on the machine; compose stacks are namespaced by machine ID.
- **demo** — logical grouping only.

RBAC roles (`viewer` · `operator` · `admin`) are always intersected with project membership.

---

## Events

Lifecycle events use the CloudEvents structured envelope. They are available through:

- `GET /api/v1/events` — history
- `GET /api/v1/events/stream` — authenticated SSE
- Optional webhook sink (`KRYTON_EVENT_WEBHOOK_URL`)

Dockur provisioning additionally emits `io.kryton.machine.install.started` when unattended setup begins.

---

## Diagnostics

`internal/doctor` runs provider-aware health checks exposed as `GET /api/v1/doctor` and `krytonctl doctor`. Checks include auth mode, projects, catalog, provider health, and (for dockur) runtime, compose, KVM, and data-dir writability. For kubevirt it also checks namespaces, DataSources, snapshot CRDs, and StorageClass ↔ VolumeSnapshotClass pairing.

`POST /api/v1/settings/test` and Settings → **Test connection** run live probes (Kubernetes, KubeVirt, storage, kubectl, install scripts).

## Storage and Atlas

KubeVirt VM disks need a CSI StorageClass with a matching VolumeSnapshotClass — see [STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md). Operators can install Rook/Longhorn from Settings or scripts, and set the Kryton default StorageClass via UI/API (`~/.kryton/storage.json`).

Optional **Atlas** integration ([ATLAS.md](ATLAS.md)) points Kryton at the Zyvor storage control plane (`product: kryton`) for discovery and ownership conventions.

## Public API surface

Other products discover Kryton via `GET /api/v1` and `GET /openapi.yaml`. Cross-origin browser clients need `KRYTON_CORS_ORIGINS`. See [API.md](API.md).

---

## Security boundaries

Kryton does not expose raw QEMU, RDP, WinRM, or arbitrary PowerShell execution through the API.

- **API keys** for service-to-service use (SHA-256 digests stored, raw tokens never persisted). How to mint and retrieve keys: [AUTH.md](AUTH.md).
- **Proxy auth** for browser SSO via trusted reverse proxy headers.
- Production KubeVirt mode refuses to start with authentication disabled unless the operator explicitly opts into insecure operation (`KRYTON_ALLOW_INSECURE=true`).
- The dockur provider is intended for labs; use API-key auth on shared hosts.

Console and RDP ports for dockur are published on the host — restrict with firewall policy.
