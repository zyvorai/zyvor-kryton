Kryton is a small, open-source (Apache-2.0) control-plane API for Windows
and Linux machines — one stable REST+CloudEvents contract in front of
interchangeable backends (demo, dockur, libvirt, KubeVirt). It is not a Windows installer or
activation service, not a raw KubeVirt YAML factory, and not a full desktop
virtualization/VDI product in its own right.

For the full project overview — quick start, install, project layout, and
the "how to use Kryton" walkthrough — see the
[README on GitHub](https://github.com/zyvorai/kryton).

## What's included today

<div class="icon-badge-list" markdown="1">

- 🆔 Stable UUIDs, independent of namespace or provider name
- 🔐 API keys or trusted reverse-proxy auth, secure by default
- ♻️ Day-2 ops: start / stop / snapshot / TTL expiry, SSE + webhooks
- 🩺 `krytonctl doctor` + `/api/v1/doctor` diagnostics
- 🖥️ Operator dashboard with collapsible rail (light/dark)
- 📜 Apache-2.0 — no Windows media or keys shipped

</div>

- **[Documentation index](https://github.com/zyvorai/kryton/blob/main/docs/README.md)** — the full "I want to… → read" map, plus scripts reference
- **[Authentication](AUTH.md)** — get and use the API key

Troubleshooting is covered inline in the relevant guide rather than a
separate document — see the "Troubleshooting" sections of
[User guide](USER-GUIDE.md#troubleshooting),
[Authentication](AUTH.md#troubleshooting), and
[KubeVirt](KUBEVIRT.md#troubleshooting).
